# Poetry Generator

![](PoetryGen1.png)

Emulating the constraints and forms of poetry, I wrote this program to generate compositions evocative of text and language. Even though the alphabet of grid-aligned characters is randomly generated, the look and feel of each piece is far from random. In addition to choosing between left-to-right/right-to-left/top-to-bottom reading orders and phonetic vs pictographic character sets, the program generates repetition, stanzas, and even it's own version of "rhyme". Look closely.
